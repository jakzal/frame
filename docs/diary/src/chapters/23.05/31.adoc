= The one with a demo

I've decided to give https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/compose-multiplatform/[Compose Multiplatform] a go.

Declarative framework for sharing UIs across multiple platforms. Based on Kotlin and Jetpack Compose.

Since I'm totally new to Compose and have no understanding of what's required to bootstrap it,
I generated a demo Compose Multiplatform project in IntelliJ.

== Build problems

I immediately run into build problems. You'd expect IntelliJ knows how to generate a project it could build...

The application run just fine from command line:

```bash
./gradlew run
```

That made me look at the project SDKs.

Not sure why all kinds of different JDK versions were set up for the project modules by IntelliJ.

Aligning them has not helped much (in `Project Structure` -> `Project` and `Modules`).

[TIP]
====
Shortcut tip:

* `Cmd+Shift+A` (MacOS)
* `Ctrl+Shift+A` (Win/Linux)

To run any action in IntelliJ IDEA press the above combination
and start typing the name of the action you'd like to invoke.

What ultimately fixed the problem was setting the `Gradle JVM`
(`Settings` -> `Build, Execution, Deployment` -> `Gradle`).
I keep forgetting to do this and it defaults to 1.8.

I usually don't have this problem in command line thanks to https://sdkman.io/[sdkman].

== Learning to display an image

First thing I needed to learn is how to display an image.

The generated demo shows a button that changes the text on click.
It was easy enough to tweak it to show an image instead.
I also tweaked the window title and made the app start in fullscreen.

== Learning to change the view

I'd like the application to be mostly implemented outside of the view,
and let the view to be a dummy layer that acts on commands.
The next thing I verified is how to update the view.

Compose has a special https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/state:[syntax for mutable state].
Such state is monitored and the UI is automatically updated when state changes.

== Building distributions

The last thing I wanted to check is how to package a Compose Multiplatform app.
The demo is pre-configured, so running `./gradlew package` creates a package for the current platform.

So far I was only able to test it on MacOS. It generates a `dmg` file that can be used to install the application on MacOS.

I will still need to confirm if it's possible to generate cross-platform packages,
so that I could generate a package for Raspberry PI on my computer or the CI server.

== Summary

So far so good.

Compose seems to be easy to work with.
I'm not worried about its stability since my UI will be rather simple.
I will also attempt to structure the app in a way that's not coupled to the UI,
so that it's not super hard to replace. At least in the early phases of the project.
