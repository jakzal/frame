= The one with the goal

I'm building a digital frame based on a Raspberry Pi.

The main **goal** is to make it **displays photos from an sdcard in my living room**.

Once the main goal is achieved I will look into additional features.
Some of the ideas I have include:

* to show weather in my location
* to play videos
* to show media from the cloud
* to control lights
* to show temperature gathered from room sensors by homeassistant
* to show a picture submitted to the frame via HTTP or bluetooth
* to control the frame with a touch interface
* to control the frame with an HTTP based API
* to provide a way to write custom plugins

I already have some great ideas for a greatly overcomplicated architecture.
There's so many cool things we could do with https://mqtt.org[MQTT].

I will keep these ideas at bay but let them inform my design.
I will only introduce enough complexity that's required for the current or upcoming features.
Hopefully, this will be a nice demonstration of how to practice evolutionary design.

As with most projects the budget is limited. In this case, the budget is my availability and interest.
Once I run out of those the project might be killed.

I will implement it in a language I enjoy, not the one that's best for the platform I've chosen.
I'm doing it for fun after all.

I do not enjoy Python. I do enjoy **Kotlin**.

I have used Kotlin before but only within a web realm.
I have never built desktop application in Kotlin, so this will be a new experience for me.

Ideally, I'd like the application to run on more platforms than just the Raspberry Pi.
I'd like it to run with minimum dependencies and required setup.
