= The one with two steps back and three steps forward

I thought the Compose Multiplatform layer will become a separate module eventually.
I expected that I will need to extract it at some point as the project grows.

After reading some more about Compose Multiplatform, Jetpack Compose, and Kotlin Multiplatform projects
I decided it is important to isolate Compose in its own Gradle subproject from the beginning.
I don't want it to impose structure or tools on my whole project. I want it to be a plugin to my application.
Compose still uses junit4? No problem! It's only a fraction of the whole test suite isolated in this little module.

It took me a couple of two-hour sessions to figure this out, as it isn't the default way
people create Compose Multiplatform projects. When I started, I didn't really understand what I was doing.
The exercise, however, let me understand Compose Multiplatform a little bit better.

As I was figuring it out I've been creating a https://mikadomethod.info/[Mikado Graph]
of steps required.

When figuring things out and hacking around we sometimes make changes that aren't contributing to the solution.
We're making a mess.

To make sure I only make necessary changes, I've been regularly reverting the changes, recreating the graph,
building the project, running tests, and finding new steps that are required.

My starting point was the demo I generated the other day.
However, I only wanted to use the code I understand.

At some point I stopped encountering compilation errors and the simple compose test I wrote
was passing. That meant my graph was complete. I could revert everything and start over one last time.
This time committing the changes.

Below are the steps I followed. Each step ends to a project that compiles.

== Downgrading the Kotlin Gradle plugin

1. Downgrade the Kotlin Gradle plugin to 1.8.20 for compatibility with the Multiplatform plugin.
+
I bootstrapped the project with Kotlin 1.8.21, so I had to downgrade it for now:
+
[source,kotlin]
.build-logic/build.gradle.kts
----
include::git@build-logic/build.gradle.kts[revision=8994b964e72f8d853d899b8cab4737096f5b008f,lines=17..19]
----
+
2. Configure the kotlin version for the gradle plugin based on a gradle property.
+
[source,properties]
.gradle.properties
----
include::git@gradle.properties[revision=ab9c9dec47bd6659cef3bf8b60b743c9b01d50dd,lines=6]

[source,kotlin]
.settings.gradle.kts

include::git@settings.gradle.kts[revision=ab9c9dec47bd6659cef3bf8b60b743c9b01d50dd,lines=11;15..18]
----
+
3. Do not specify the kotlin gradle plugin version explicitly.
+
[source,kotlin]
.build-logic/build.gradle.kts
----
include::git@build-logic/build.gradle.kts[revision=2a59aa7d59e353eb1498eb1fb23b83ce795d55e5,lines=17..19]
----

== Bootstrapping the app project

My Compose project will be called `app`.

1. Create the `app` project by adding an empty `app/build.gradle.kts` build file.

2. Include the `app` project in the main project build.
+
[source,kotlin]
.settings.gradle.kts
----
include::git@settings.gradle.kts[revision=57b3719e4f6a87fc9c2a6a82007a7d1acc994ae5,lines=25..27]
----

3. Define plugin versions for Kotlin Multiplatform and Compose.
+
[source,properties]
.gradle.properties
----
include::git@gradle.properties[revision=9e54bc97d6c9f4fdc2d0b319e2ae42fafbe77c39,lines=7]
----
+
[source,kotlin]
.settings.gradle.kts
----
include::git@settings.gradle.kts[revision=9e54bc97d6c9f4fdc2d0b319e2ae42fafbe77c39,lines=15..19]
----

4. Enable Kotlin Multiplatform and Compose in the `app` project.
+
[source,kotlin]
.app/build.gradle.kts
----
include::git@app/build.gradle.kts[revision=e87bc697f01573866cebf640a1482aa1b9b14ead]
----
+
Prevent compilation failures due to
the Kotlin Gradle plugin loaded multiple times by defining the Multiplatform plugin without applying it
in `settings.gradle.kts`.
+
[source,kotlin]
.settings.gradle.kts
----
include::git@settings.gradle.kts[revision=e87bc697f01573866cebf640a1482aa1b9b14ead,lines=22;25..26]
----
+
The `app` project will not use our common `build-logic`, but it's fine since there's little it has in common
with non-multiplatform builds.

5. Confirm the `app` project can load classes from a non-multiplatform project.
+
Create a class in the `frame` project:
+
[source,kotlin]
.frame/src/main/kotlin/pl/zalas/frame/Foo.kt
----
include::git@frame/src/main/kotlin/pl/zalas/frame/Foo.kt[revision=dd8d7233200f6a0f731c967216baee225796cb11]
----
Create a class in the `app` project that uses the class from `frame`:
+
[source,kotlin]
.app/src/commonMain/kotlin/pl/zalas/frame/app/Bar.kt
----
include::git@app/src/commonMain/kotlin/pl/zalas/frame/app/Bar.kt[revision=dd8d7233200f6a0f731c967216baee225796cb11]
----
+
Declare the `frame` project dependency in the `app`:
+
[source,kotlin]
.app/build.gradle.kts
----
include::git@app/build.gradle.kts[revision=dd8d7233200f6a0f731c967216baee225796cb11,lines=16;21..30]
----
+
Revert this change before continuing.

== Bootstrapping tests for Compose Multiplatform

Here I mostly used examples found in the official
https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/testing[Jetpack Compose testing docs].

1. Add test dependencies to the app project.
+
[source,kotlin]
.app/build.gradle.kts
----
include::git@app/build.gradle.kts[revision=d7a77e414d2f9947bfaabe703b569699a9001982,lines=16;21;28..37]
----
+
I need to make a note to remove the version number for junit vintage engine from here,
so it's in sync with the version used in other projects.
+
Unfortunately, Compose uses junit4.

2. Add a test that verifies an image is shown.
+
[source,kotlin]
.app/src/commonTest/kotlin/pl/zalas/frame/app/AppTest.kt
----
include::git@app/src/commonTest/kotlin/pl/zalas/frame/app/AppTest.kt[revision=8279637faff0f26a7cd84228523feecd782db974]
----
+
It's not great test, but it's a good start.
+
We'll also need an empty App so the code compiles:
+
[source,kotlin]
.app/src/commonMain/kotlin/pl/zalas/frame/app/Main.kt
----
include::git@app/src/commonMain/kotlin/pl/zalas/frame/app/Main.kt[revision=8279637faff0f26a7cd84228523feecd782db974]
----

3. Make the test pass.
+
[source,kotlin]
.app/src/commonMain/kotlin/pl/zalas/frame/app/Main.kt
----
include::git@app/src/commonMain/kotlin/pl/zalas/frame/app/Main.kt[revision=8f6cb8d1a705cee7b8dac92e63024f1e64380804,lines=11..20]
----

4. Configure the jvmTest task to log executed tests in cli.
+
[source,kotlin]
.app/build.gradle.kts
----
include::git@app/build.gradle.kts[revision=62064e1afa3bc83fe5c9f27f54fa868b0405d768,lines=39..47]
----

5. Configure the IDE to run all tests with Gradle rather than junit configuration.
+
.All tests configuration
image::gradle-all-tests-configuration.png[All tests configuration]
+
We can now run all the project tests with a single click or shortcut.

I have now completed all the steps to reach the goal at the top of the Mikado Graph.

.Mikado Graph

== The main

Finally, I added the `main()` function based on what I've had in the demo project.
This is so I could manually test.

[source,kotlin]
.app/src/commonMain/kotlin/pl/zalas/frame/app/Main.kt
----
include::git@app/src/commonMain/kotlin/pl/zalas/frame/app/Main.kt[revision=7c9a6930d4fb5c77fcb3c6e776fda461fbf950a8,lines=28..35]
----

I also configured compose, so I could run it from command line with `./gradlew app:run`:

[source,kotlin]
.app/build.gradle.kts
----
include::git@app/build.gradle.kts[revision=7c9a6930d4fb5c77fcb3c6e776fda461fbf950a8,lines=49..53]
----

== Summary

I feel like it was a struggle, but a necessary one.

I managed to keep Compose Multiplatform isolated from the rest of the project.
A big win, since I'm still not fully committed to it.

Good result, given that at one point I was about to give up.

I found the Mikado Method extremely helpful while not only restructuring,
but also adding new code.
