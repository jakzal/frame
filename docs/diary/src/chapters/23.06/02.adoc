= The one with the clean slate

== Starting fresh

I started the day with generating a fresh Gradle project using the gradle command.
Just like most of the times I have chosen to use subprojects.

.gradle init
image::gradle-init.png[gradle init]

Since Gradle generates example subprojects I always need to clean it up and remove unneded code before continuing.
I do it this way to keep myself up to date with latest Gradle goodies, but also to get
the `build-logic` subproject (previously `buildSrc`).

Just to aid IntelliJ a bit I also configured the jvm toolchain in Gradle.
Unfortunately it keeps defaulting to Java 1.8 so when the project is first imported to IntelliJ,
the Project SDK, Gradle JVM, and the Target JVM Version in Kotlin Compiler settings need to be configured.

Next, I moved on to replacing the explicit use of JUnit with kotlin.test:

and wrote a test to verify IntelliJ knows how to run them:

include::git@frame/src/test/kotlin/frame/VerificationTest.kt[revision=e585b147d1a64500fc6699767d3359e7ab9da40d]
----

IntelliJ didn't want to cooperate to run all the tests and complained:

```
Error running 'All in frame': No junit.jar
```

I had to additionally tweak the run configuration to search for tests in the whole project:

.test run configuration
image::test-run-configuration.png[test run configuration]

Now we're ready to start doing some real work.

.test run verification
image::test-run-verification.png[test run verification]

Except...

== Learning coroutines

I wasn't sure where to start.

I will need some kind of asynchronous message sending/handling.

I thought I could leverage the Actor model. I have some experience using and contributing to Vlingo XOOM,
a java based implementation. Compared to XOOM, Kotlin's actor implementation is very basic.

It's part of an obsolete API anyway, so it's time to look into Kotlin coroutines. Back to the learning mode.

I headed to the https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coroutines-guide.html[Coroutines Guide] and
https://kotlinlang.org/api/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-test/[Coroutines Testing Documentation],
started playing with examples in learning tests.

First things first. Let me see how to launch a coroutine.

`runTest` behaves similarly to `runBlocking`, but has some features useful in tests.
For example, it skips calls to delay while preserving the relative execution order.
The test above only takes milliseconds to run, instead of over a second.

Managing state this way is not thread safe, but I'm sure I'll learn how to do it properly soon.

https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coroutines-and-channels.html#channels[Channels] are a way for coroutines
to communicate with each other.

There are four types of channels.

rendezvous (default):

I also tried adding `delay()` calls in between `channel.send()` calls to see how it affects the receiver.

If there's more than one receiver, each message is still handled only once:

----

For the project, I will need to potentially each message to be handled by multiple receivers.
It seems that `BroadcastChannel` used to be the way to go, but it's now being replaced with `SharedFlow`.

== Summary

I've learnt some Kotlin coroutine basics but there's still some docs I haven't even read.
I sure don't know enough to send a single message to multiple coroutines.
