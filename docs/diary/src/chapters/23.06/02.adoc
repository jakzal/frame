= The one with the clean slate

== Starting fresh

I started the day with generating a fresh Gradle project using the gradle command.
Just like most of the times I have chosen to use subprojects.

.gradle init
image::gradle-init.png[gradle init]

Since Gradle generates example subprojects I always need to clean it up and remove unneded code before continuing.
I do it this way to keep myself up to date with latest Gradle goodies, but also to get
the `build-logic` subproject (previously `buildSrc`).

Just to aid IntelliJ a bit I also configured the jvm toolchain in Gradle.
Unfortunately it keeps defaulting to Java 1.8 so when the project is first imported to IntelliJ,
the Project SDK, Gradle JVM, and the Target JVM Version in Kotlin Compiler settings need to be configured.

[source,kotlin]
.build-logic/src/main/kotlin/frame.kotlin-common-conventions.gradle.kts
----
include::git@build-logic/src/main/kotlin/frame.kotlin-common-conventions.gradle.kts[revision=075996fa34d80442b669c76ff8ee220df176caf8,lines=20..22]

Next, I moved on to replacing the explicit use of JUnit with kotlin.test:

[source,kotlin]
.build-logic/src/main/kotlin/frame.kotlin-common-conventions.gradle.kts
----
include::git@build-logic/src/main/kotlin/frame.kotlin-common-conventions.gradle.kts[revision=8b8a569231284edb5e15157e4944149a6f92129f,lines=9..11]

and wrote a test to verify IntelliJ knows how to run them:

[source,kotlin]
.frame/src/test/kotlin/frame/VerificationTest.kt
----
include::git@frame/src/test/kotlin/frame/VerificationTest.kt[revision=e585b147d1a64500fc6699767d3359e7ab9da40d]
----

IntelliJ didn't want to cooperate to run all the tests and complained:

```
Error running 'All in frame': No junit.jar
```

I had to additionally tweak the run configuration to search for tests in the whole project:

.test run configuration
image::test-run-configuration.png[test run configuration]

Now we're ready to start doing some real work.

.test run verification
image::test-run-verification.png[test run verification]
